                <strong>Why are you taking this course?</strong>
                
                I've been programming since I was 12 but with more of a focus
                on computer graphics and embedded applications. Even during my
                time here at Tufts, I've yet to take a course about web
                technologies. I have made a personal website to write about
                computer graphics and other things I find interesting, but that
                is about the extent of my web experience. I'm hoping to fill in
                some of the gaps in my C.S. knowledge with this course.

                <strong>What are your 3 favorite foods?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Russian Hamburgers</li>
                    <li>Sushi</li>
                    <li>Spam Musubis</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
               <strong>Which one is your most favorite?</strong>

                   <img src="bierocks.webp" alt="Bierocks"></img>
                   Growing up, my mom always made bierocks (we called them
                   russian hamburgers). Ours only had beef and cabbage inside,
                   and they were shaped like pyramids made out of crescent roll
                   dough. We always put butter on the outside. I know a lot of
                   people tend to put other ingredients, like peppers and
                   onions, inside.

                <strong>What is your favorite restaurant?</strong>

                I really enjoy the pork belly mac and cheese at
                <a href="https://www.grassapdx.com/">Grassa</a>
                in Portland, Oregon. My friends and I ate there many times
                while we were going to school at Lewis and Clark College.
